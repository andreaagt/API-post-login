# Node express API

<p>In this file, I develop an API that create a Lesson and post 
a message and relates it with the user that created it.
Another thing that I worked was the method to works with cookies using express-session method and 
jwt method. With this methods (that are in the corresponding branch) I create a route for 
login, logout and register a user</p>
